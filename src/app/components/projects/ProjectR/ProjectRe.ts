    fun1Description: ` Security is a core focus of the platform, achieved through user registration and 
    authentication. Users can authenticate locally using email, with future possibilities for phone-based authentication. 
    Additionally, options for online authentication via Google, Apple, and Facebook are planned. These methods will offer users convenient access to their listings, reservations, personal information, and more. As sensitive data 
    is involved, I have planned to integrate robust tools to ensure data protection and privacy. Further details will 
    be provided in the next stages.`,

    fun3Description: `To make a reservation, users need to meet the age requirement and provide some basic information. 
    Iâ€™ve streamlined the process to be 
    user-friendly: simply choose the desired location, add a few reservation details, and the reservation is set!.
    Oops but plans can change, then you can altere date, hour or even table type, after check-in you can left your 
    thoughts about your refection, that's means it's easy to manage your reservation but you must considere your host
    rules

    summary: ` Here are the core technical aspects of the project. For the backend logic, I used the NestJS framework, built on Node.js, and 
    incorporated tools like BCRYPT for password encryption, reducing user account exposure in case of attacks. Additionally, JWT was used for 
    secure authentication, and MongoDB was chosen for data storage. The frontend was built using Expo (React Native) to create the UI and integrate with the API.
