        I&apos;m <span className='font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-900 via-fuchsia-950 to-black'>software developer</span> and I like the thought of transforming ideas into innovative and
        functional solutions, this way I chose technology for my professional career. With a
        technical background and hands-on experience in <span className='font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-900 via-fuchsia-950 to-black'>software development</span>,
        <span className='font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-900 via-fuchsia-950 to-black'> software design</span>. I want to specialize
        in creating efficient, high-quality applications that meet users&apos; needs.<br /><br />

        My journey in software engineering began with curiosity and became more intense when I got to
        the University. I&apos;ve worked on a wide range of projects, from <span className='font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-900 via-fuchsia-950 to-black'>mobile applications</span> to
        <span className='font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-900 via-fuchsia-950 to-black'> backend systems</span>.
        I&apos;ve experience with Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and now a little bit of Kotlin and have worked
        with Spring Boot, NestJS, React Native. I&apos;ve already used tools like AngularJS, PHP, among others.<br /><br />
        In addition to my technical skills, I highly value collaboration and effective communication within teams.
        Because the success of a project depends not only on technical solutions but also on understanding and aligning with stakeholders&apos; needs.
        <br />
        I am seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Whether contributing to a team or exploring
        new technologies.
