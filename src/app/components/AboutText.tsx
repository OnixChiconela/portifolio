        My journey in software engineering began with curiosity and became more intense when I get in
        the University, I've worked on a wide range of projects, from <text className='font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-900 via-fuchsia-950 to-black'>mobile applications</text> to 
        <text className='font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-900 via-fuchsia-950 to-black'> backend systems</text>.
        I've experience with Java, TypeScript, JavaScript and now a little bit of kotlin and have worked
        with Spring Boot, NestJS, React Native, I,ve already use tools like Angular JS, PHP, among others.<br /><br />

        In addition to my technical skills, I highly value collaboration and effective communication within teams.
        Because the sucess of a project depends not only on technical solutions but also on understandig and aligning with stakeholders'needs.
        <br />
        I am seeking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Whether contributing to a team, or exploring
        new technologies
